# Parse Conversation Data Using StanfordNLP

While working with this conversational data, we have formed some hypotheses.

# Our hypothesis is:

Male chat participants have different language patterns when conversing in chat rooms than do female chat participants. They may speak in shorter sentences and use more pronouns while speaking.

# Alternate Hypothesis

# Hypothesis 1: 
Male chat participants speak in significantly shorter sentences than do female chat participants.

# Proven: 
There is no significant difference between sentences spoken by male chat participants and female chat participants.

# Hypothesis 2: 
Male chat participants use significantly more pronouns than do female chat participants.

# Proven: 
There is no significant difference between number of pronouns spoken by male chat participants and female chat participants.

Average number of pronouns used by males: 38.2 </br>
Average number of pronouns used by females: 47.6
