# Parse Conversation Data Using StanfordNLP






While working with this conversational data, we have formed some hypotheses.

Our hypothesis is:

Male chat participants have different language patterns when conversing in chat rooms than do female chat participants. They may speak in shorter sentences and use more pronouns while speaking. 
What are the null hypotheses for the alternate hypotheses listed below:
Hypothesis 1: Male chat participants speak in significantly shorter sentences than do female chat participants.
Proven: There is no significant difference between sentences spoken by male chat participants and female chat participants.
Hypothesis 2: Male chat participants use significantly more pronouns than do female chat participants.
Proven: There is no significant difference between number of pronouns spoken by male chat participants and female chat participants.

A table of results as below by counting the number of pronouns each participant, either male of female, has made in both conversations.

Males	File	Pronouns	Females	File	Pronouns
